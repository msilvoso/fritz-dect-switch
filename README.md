These are the scripts that I use on a raspberry pi to control a Fritz!DECT switch to automatically switch off a firewall in my cellar every night. 
There is also a basic menu that allows to switch on, manually switch off the firewall, or disable the autooff.
This is a bit rough, sorry for that. If you use this for any of your projects you will have to do quite a bit of work.

You have to copy the LCD library from the Adafruit repository into the lib/lcd folder https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code
